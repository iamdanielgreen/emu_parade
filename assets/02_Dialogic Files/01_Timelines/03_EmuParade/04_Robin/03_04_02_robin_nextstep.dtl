robin: I know we've only just met, but can I ask another favour?
cassie: Sure! 
cassie: Well, you can ask, anyway.
robin: Could you deliver Wren's lunch to them?
cassie: I can do that.
robin: Oh, thank you!
cassie: No trouble at all!
robin: If you squint, you can just make Wren out - over on the far edge of the park, by the playground.
cassie: The one who looks like they're staring into space?
robin: *Sigh*
robin: That's them.
robin: I'd hurry, if I were you.
cassie: I'm on it!
