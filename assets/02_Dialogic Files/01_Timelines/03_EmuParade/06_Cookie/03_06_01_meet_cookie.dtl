cassie: Hello?
cookie: I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE CUPS, MAGGIE.
cookie:...
cookie: Uh, you're not Maggie.
cassie: No, I'm Cassie. I think I'm the reason Maggie's mad about coffee cups.
cookie: Nah. She's been like that for the last 500 years. She'll get over it.
cookie: Funny thing is, I did order some biodegradable cups so that Maggie would stop hassling me about it.
cookie: But the company won't send the cups until I pay them. And I can't pay them until I get the invoice.
cookie: And that invoice has to come in the mail because Emu Parade is apparently not the only place stuck in the early 2000s.
cookie: I think the letter got lost.
