18/04/2025

- At some point you killed the Quit Game button
- changed opening scene to cassie's bedroom
- removed reminder to set gamemanager as global
- created cassie_sleeping character
- got cassie to wake up and make the bed (she should be on the other side though)
- something is causing her to be invisible when loading into new world, but heck it.
- - as ONE MORE THING, had cassie load in to living room
- - - Which worked, except you basically need cassie to have visibility always turned on at the start of a new level because you currently can't see her.

WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU DID A BUILD, BRUH. (Actually, it was 22/04)

19/04/2025

- THING TO ADD: All items float on first interact. Turn float off/make idle once interacted with.
- THING TO ADD: Phone shows PRESS X to interact on first approach. Hide UI [interact_ui.hide()] once that occurs.
- THING TO ADD: Thing floats on first approach, then gets interact icon once they enter InteractZone.

- Made notes for post mortem
- did not make cassie be consistently visible - have to do it manually
- worked on living room/kitchen

- Worked on living room while watching a film.
- Added details to bedroom
- Added Cassie sleeping animation (or made it work, anyway)
- Fixed wall ordering things in livingroom
- Replaced kitchen assets with shadowless tileset, thus breaking the existing kitchen which you then fixed.
- Finished bedroom. Pretty sure I did, anyway.
- Mostly finished living room
- - Though none of the borders are in place, so she can walk through everything.

21/04/2025
- Made two pieces of music (and one piece of credits music)
- - Cassie is sleeping / Cassie is awake

Playtest Notes with Kate - 23/04/2025

- Text is very small
- Fix bedroom physics
- Cassie needs to be in front of the TV
- - move table, more boxes
- Remove / fix playtest end screen so cassie can go outside
- Have Cassie wonder where her phone is
- No physics outside
- Fix Cassie's house position
- Make UI prompts more prominent, at least in middle of screen
- Can trigger phone from bed?
- - Invisible Cassie can. Make glow zone smaller.
- Have Cassie wake up on left of bed.
- Green grocer boxes don't scan as moving boxes
- Prioritise larger spaces on the street, as that's ultimately where the action is
- - You understand the trope(s) you're referring to, but that doesn't necessarily translate to others - nor have your designed it to be.
- Have something in the kitchen to interact with if there's time.
- "The feel is quite charming."
- "The dialogue with Maggie is nice."

24/04/2025 (well, it's 00:26 so that's technically true)
- you made the UI prompt disappear when you want it to, but you still need an interaction icon because the glow isn't enough
- - there is *something* about adding said icon through Godot that really is causing problems. You might need to edit the sprite itself.
- UI prompt also doesn't appear with TV depending on whether or not you find the phone
- Added test icon to phone. Not perfect, but it works.
